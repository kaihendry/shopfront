# About
"*LindyPress.net* is a publisher of hard-to-find and out-of-print books.

## Print-on-demand
LindyPress.net uses a print-on-demand service (Lulu) to provide books. This allows us to produce and sell rare books without the massive financial risk of preprinting hundreds of books.

Lulu handles both printing and shipping, which means that in the rare case of there being issues with either, such as shipping delays or printing errors, contact them here.

## Books to Add
We are often looking for books to add to our collection. Suggestions may be sent to . We have a preferrence for premodern books, and are open to publishing in English, Latin or Greek, but potentially other European languages if the opportunity arises.

Note that for legal reasons, we only print books whose texts or translations are in the public domain in the United States and Europe. Thankfully, that makes nearly everything before 1900 fair game.

## Support LindyPress.net

The process of designing and typesetting rare books, although rewarding, is not often financially so. If you would like to support our efforts, you may donate Bitcoin or Monero to our long-term fund. Email  if you would like it earmarked for a particular book or project."
